# pitfalls

A pacifistic MineSweeper-like game used to practice TDD.
(The idea is that you fall into a pit if not careful. But noone gets blown to pieces. :-) )

Plan to try several methods for a GUI.
Ideas: 
* NodeJS
* React/Redux
* Swing
* JavaFX
Will have to find out how to do TDD for the GUI first ;-)

Other (not GUI-related) plans still brewing.
